/*
The main difference between a named constructor and a redirecting constructor lies in their purpose and behavior:

1. Named Constructor:
   - A named constructor is an additional constructor in a class that has a unique name.
   - It is used to provide alternative ways to create objects or to initialize objects differently based on different parameters.
   - Named constructors have their own body where you can define custom initialization logic.
   - They are invoked explicitly by using the class name followed by the constructor name.
   - Example:
     

     class Person {
       String name;
       int age;

       // Named constructor
       Person.fromBirthYear(int birthYear) {
         name = 'Unknown';
         age = DateTime.now().year - birthYear;
       }
     }
     


2. Redirecting Constructor:
   - A redirecting constructor allows you to redirect the initialization process to another constructor in the same class.
   - It is used to reuse the initialization logic of another constructor.
   - Instead of defining its own body, a redirecting constructor only specifies the target constructor using a colon (`:`) followed by `this` keyword and the appropriate arguments.
   - This way, any initialization logic written in the target constructor will be executed.
   - Example:
     

     class Person {
       String name;
       int age;

       // Redirecting constructor
       Person.fromBirthYear(int birthYear) : this('Unknown', DateTime.now().year - birthYear);

       // Parameterized constructor
       Person(this.name, this.age);
     }
     


In summary, a named constructor provides an alternative way to create or initialize objects, while a redirecting constructor allows you to reuse the initialization logic of another constructor by redirecting the initialization process to it.
