/*
The `provider` package is a state management solution in Flutter that allows you to share and manage state across your widget tree. It follows the concept of "Inversion of Control" where the widgets consuming the state do not have to worry about managing the state themselves.

Here are the key concepts we covered:

1. `ChangeNotifier`:
   - `ChangeNotifier` is a class provided by the `provider` package that you can extend to create your own state model.
   - It provides a way to notify listeners whenever the state changes using the `notifyListeners()` method.

2. `Provider`:
   - `Provider` is a widget that allows you to provide an instance of a state model to its descendants.
   - It takes a `create` parameter, which is responsible for creating the instance of the state model.
   - The descendants of the `Provider` widget can access the state model using `Provider.of(context)`.

3. `Consumer`:
   - The `Consumer` widget is used to consume and react to changes in the shared state.
   - It takes a `builder` function as a parameter, which is called whenever the state changes.
   - The `builder` function receives the context and the current instance of the shared state as arguments.

4. `Selector`:
   - The `Selector` widget allows you to select a specific part of the state that your widget depends on.
   - It takes a `selector` function as a parameter, which is responsible for extracting the desired part of the state.
   - When the selected part of the state changes, only the widget subtree defined inside the `builder` function is rebuilt.

5. `Consumer2`, `Consumer3`, ...:
   - The `Consumer2`, `Consumer3`, and so on, widgets are similar to `Consumer`, but they allow you to consume multiple state models at once.
   - They take multiple `builder` functions as parameters, each corresponding to a different state model.

6. `Provider.value`:
   - `Provider.value` is a variation of the `Provider` widget that is used when you want to provide an existing instance of a state model.
   - It is useful when the state model is created outside the widget tree and needs to be shared across multiple parts of the app.

Remember that the `provider` package is a powerful tool for managing state in Flutter, providing a simple and efficient way to share and react to changes in the state across your widget tree.
